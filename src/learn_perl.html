    In Perl, the regular expressions are usually placed between two slashed: <b>/\d+/</b>.
    Beacuse of this, if you'd like to match a slash, you need to escape it using a backslash:
    <r>/\/usr\/bin\/perl/</r> which does not look good. To avoid this problem, Perl allows you
    to change the delimiter of the regular expressions, assuming you use the letter <b>m</b> (that stands for matching)
    in front of the regex. For example like this: <r>m{/usr/bin/perl}</r>
    </p>
    <p>
    There are several ways to use regular expressions in Perl, the most common way is to use it in a condition,
    to see if a given string matches the given regex:
    </p>
    <pre>
    if ($str =~ /\d+/) {
    }
    </pre>
