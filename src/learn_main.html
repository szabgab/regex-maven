    Regular Expressions - or in its shorter name - Regexes - are built using a small language
    capable of describing pattern of text. Hence the subject also called Pattern Matching.
    This language can be used as part of other programming languages, and as part
    of some editors and a number of other tools.
    </p>
    <p>
    Regexes are used to fetch part of a string, for input validation and even to
    substitute part of a string by some other string.
