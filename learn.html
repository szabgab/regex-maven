Regular Expressions - or in its shorter name - Regexes - are built using a small language
capable of describing pattern of text. Hence the subject also called Pattern Matching.
This language can be used as part of other programming languages, and as part
of some editors and a number of other tools.
</p>
<p>
Regexes are used to fetch part of a string, for input validation and even to
substitute part of a string by some other string.

In Perl, the regular expressions are usually placed between two slashed: <r>/\d+/</r>.
Beacuse of this, if you'd like to match a slash, you need to escape it using a backslash:
<r>/\/usr\/bin\/perl/</r> which does not look good. To avoid this problem, Perl allows you
to change the delimiter of the regular expressions, assuming you use the letter <b>m</b> (that stands for matching)
in front of the regex. For example like this: <r>m{/usr/bin/perl}</r>
</p>
<p>
There are several ways to use regular expressions in Perl, the most common way is to use it in a condition,
to see if a given string matches the given regex:
</p>
<code>
if ($str =~ /\d+/) {
}
</code>
