Contributor agreement
=======================

While this application is open source, I plan to make part
of available only for people who made a payment.

The plan is, that all the application will be installed and
I'll use "in-game payment" to allow access to the advanced
parts of the product. What exactly will be considered "advanced"
I am not sure.

So if you plan to contribute to the code, please make sure
you accept the idea, that in the mobile compiler versions,
I might restrict access to some part of it and I might
make some money enabling it.
